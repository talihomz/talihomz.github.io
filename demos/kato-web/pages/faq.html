We normally vouch for our member's reputation when requested for a reference by tourists.
                The Ethics & Standards Sub-Committee is set-up to oversee member discipline and ensure that members abide by the Association's Code of Conduct.

                <h2>How much does a safari cost?</h2>
                            The cost of a safari vary depending on what kind of safari you wish to undertake e.g. luxury, budget, economy, etc. This could cost anywhere between US$70 to US$400 per person per night.
                <h2>Do have to pay a deposit for my safari and how much? What mode of payment should I use e.g. credit card, travellers cheque, etc?</h2>
                            It is common practice to have all costs paid for prior to commencement of the safari, as the Tour Operator has to make certain commitments to secure bookings, accommodation, flights, etc.

                            Kenya tends to be quite secure for tourists especially within the tourist circuits. You do however need to observe the basic precautions i.e. avoid walking in dark/isolated areas at night, do not wear flashy jewellery, avoid carrying valuables around, etc.

                <h2>How do I apply for a visa to Kenya?</h2>
     	
                <p>Kenya Visa applications are now only available online and the old Manual application has been stopped.
                Visitors from countries that require a Visa to enter Kenya should now apply for the Visa online from the E-Visa portal - http://evisa.go.ke/evisa.html</p>

                <p>Applicants will be required to follow the three stages indicated on the E-Visa website, namely:  

                <ul>
                    <li>Register - in order to activate your E-Visa account.</li>
                    <li>Complete the Application Form and provide a photo and passport copy).</li>
                    <li>Pay online using a debit or credit card and await the E-Visa approval.</li>
                    <li>One should download and print the E-Visa (in PDF form) and present it at the port of entry.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Key Points to note:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The 90-Day Visa Validity commences from the date of E-Visa approval … not on the date of your arrival into Kenya.   Visitors are therefore urged not to apply too early.</li>
                    <li>Some web browsers (e.g. Internet Explorer) are, for one reason or the other, experiencing problems with the E-Visa portal.   It is recommended that one uses Google Chrome which has been reported as having no problems.</li>
                    <li>The E-Visa Portal is mobile enabled and one can complete the application from a mobile device (phone or Tablet) including taking and uploading a picture.</li>
                    <li>The inclusion of additional languages is still pending but Google Chrome has the ability to translate an entire web page into the desired language of your choice.  The Industry is following up with Immigration authorities to hasten the provision of additional languages.</li>
                    <li>It should take between 12 – 24 hours to receive the E-Visa approval.  An email will be sent to you to log in and download the E-Visa.  It has been reported that this email notification is sometimes going to the ”spam email” folder.  Kindly check your spam folder before deleting the contents as you await this notification.</li>
                    <li>Tourists can upload their tour itinerary and not necessarily an “invitation letter”.</li>
                    <li>In case of extreme difficulty, your local or overseas  Tour Operator/Travel Agent is eligible to register as an “Agent” and apply on behalf of clients from time to time using the same Company email address.   The E-Visa approval will be sent back to the Agent you in the client’s name for onward forwarding to them.</li>
                    <li>The Single Entry Visa to Kenya allows for free re-entry to Kenya as long as one is travelling within the EAC countries.</li>
                    <li>The EAC Single Tourist Visa allows travel to Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda on a single fee of $100.  This is not available online and can still be applied for and issued on arrival at any port of entry.</li>
                    <li>For a limited duration of TWO months (September and October), Immigration Authorities will have E-Visa Terminal at both Jommo Kenyatta International Airport (Nairobi) and Moi International Airport  (Mombasa) from which visitors arriving without the E-Visas can apply for it on arrival.  Visitors are however strongly encouraged to apply for the E-Visa in advance of travel to Kenya so as to avoid unnecessary long delays at the Airport.  </li>
                    <li>During the two month Airlines should NOT deny boarding to a traveller on account of lack of the E- Visa - unless such a person is of a nationality that is required to have the referred Visa in advance before coming to Kenya.</li>
                    <li>The E-Visa Website has “Live Chat” enabled to address any challenges applicants may experience.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <br />

                <p>For those intending to visit more than one East African country, the EAC Single Visa allows for travel between Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda.  This Visa is applied for and issued on arrival and is not available for online issuance.</p>
